### Description: 

As a Computer Science Project, I built the Robotics Team website that serves as a hub of information about the team, its members, and the robots they create. The site features an intuitive navigation system that guides users through various pages, including the welcome, about, services, team, portal, works, and contact pages. Each page provides specific information about the team and its activities, such as pictures of the team members and robots they have built.
To build the site, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design. Additionally, I created a member dashboard that allows team members to log in and access resources such as FRC Documentation, CTRE Documentation, Google Classroom code, and more. This dashboard was powered by Stych in React, which enables a seamless user experience for team members.
Overall, the Robotics Team website is a comprehensive and informative platform that showcases the team's passion for robotics and their achievements. With its easy-to-use navigation system and member dashboard, the site provides team members with quick access to important resources and information, making it an essential tool for the Robotics Team's success.

### Tools: 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of any website, and I used it to create the basic structure of my pages. HTML is the markup language that web developers use to structure content on the web. It defines the different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, and provides the necessary structure and layout for a site. HTML is used widely in the web development industry, and is essential for creating any type of website. For my site, I used HTML to structure the content of the pages, and to ensure that the site was well-organized and easy to navigate.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language that allows web developers to control the presentation of web pages. I used CSS to add styles and visual elements to my website, such as colors, fonts, and layout. CSS is useful because it separates the presentation of a website from its content, allowing developers to make changes to the look and feel of a site without affecting its structure or functionality. CSS is widely used in the web development industry and is an essential tool for creating visually appealing websites. For my site, I used CSS to customize the colors, fonts, and layout, ensuring that the site had a professional and visually appealing look.
JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web content. I used JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my site, such as pop-ups, drop-down menus, and forms. JavaScript is useful because it allows developers to create a more engaging and interactive user experience. JavaScript is widely used in the web development industry and is an essential tool for creating modern and responsive websites. For my site, I used JavaScript to create interactive elements that made the site more engaging and user-friendly.
Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-built UI components and responsive design. I used Bootstrap to enhance the design and functionality of my site, without having to write a lot of custom CSS. Bootstrap is useful because it allows developers to create professional-looking websites quickly and efficiently. Bootstrap is widely used in the web development industry and is an essential tool for creating responsive and visually appealing websites. For my site, I used Bootstrap to create a consistent and professional-looking website that adapted to different screen sizes, ensuring that the site looked great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. I used React to create a dynamic and interactive member dashboard that allowed team members to log in and access important resources. React is useful because it allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be used across different pages and applications. React is widely used in the web development industry and is an essential tool for building modern and responsive web applications. For my site, I used React to create a member dashboard that was easy to use and navigate, and that allowed team members to access important resources such as FRC Documentation, CTRE Documentation, and Google Classroom code.
Stych is a platform that allows developers to create user interfaces quickly and efficiently. I used Stych to power the member dashboard, ensuring that it was user-friendly and efficient. Stych is useful because it allows developers to create UI components quickly and easily, without having to write a lot of custom code. Stych is not as widely used as some of the other tools mentioned here, but it is becoming increasingly popular in the web development industry. For my site, I used Stych to create a member dashboard that was easy to use and navigate, and that allowed team members to access important resources.

### Development Process: 

My development process for building the Robotics Team website and member dashboard was well-planned and structured. The site provides fellow Robotics Team Members with a wealth of information, resources, and tools that will help them in their robotics projects and competitions.
The site includes an "About" page, which provides information about the team's goals, history, and achievements. The "Services" page outlines the various services the team offers, such as training programs, workshops, and mentorship. The "Works" page showcases the team's past projects, including pictures and descriptions of the robots they've built and the competitions they've competed in.
The member dashboard provides additional resources for team members, including links to FRC and CTRE documentation, Google Classroom codes, and other useful information. Members can also access a separate page to login or sign up, which is powered by Stych in React. This allows them to securely access information and collaborate with other team members.
Overall, the site will help fellow Robotics Team Members by providing them with a central hub for all their robotics-related needs. They can easily access information about the team, past projects, and upcoming events, as well as connect with other members through the member dashboard. By using different programming tools and techniques, I was able to create a professional-quality website that meets the needs of the Robotics Team, and I'm excited to see how it will help them in their future endeavors.
